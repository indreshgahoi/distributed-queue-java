## v0.7 — Coarse-Grained Locking

### Decision
Use a single `ReentrantLock` to protect all queue state transitions.

### Why
It provides a simple correctness model for transitions spanning multiple
data structures.

### Trade-off
All state-changing operations are serialized through one lock.

This may limit concurrency under contention, but the performance impact
has not yet been measured.

### Deferred alternatives
- Fine-grained locking
- Concurrent data structures
- Lock striping

### Revisit when
Benchmarks show lock contention is a meaningful bottleneck.

## v0.8 — Force WAL on Every Durable Write

### Decision
Force each committed WAL record before reporting the operation successful.

### Why
This provides a simple durability contract for the first persistent version.

### Trade-off hypothesis
Per-operation forcing may increase latency and reduce throughput.

This has not yet been measured.

### Deferred alternatives
- Buffered WAL writes
- Group commit
- Periodic fsync
- Asynchronous durability

### Revisit when
Durability semantics are stable and benchmarks are available.

## v0.10.0 — CRC32C WAL Integrity

### Decision

Add CRC32C to every complete WAL frame.

### Gain

Recovery can detect structurally complete records whose payload bytes have
been corrupted.

### Cost

Each frame gains 4 bytes and requires checksum computation on write and
verification during recovery.

The performance impact has not yet been measured.

### Important distinction

Incomplete final frame:
recoverable torn-tail condition.

Complete frame with checksum mismatch:
corruption; fail recovery.

## v0.11.1 — Durable Delivery Leases

### Decision

Persist a `LEASE_STARTED` WAL record before exposing a delivery to a consumer.

A lease contains:

    messageId
    receiptHandle
    attempt
    leaseUntil

Active leases are reconstructed across queue restart.

### Benefit

The queue can preserve externally visible delivery ownership across restart.

Without durable lease creation:

    receive
        |
        v
    queue restart
        |
        v
    message becomes READY prematurely

With durable lease creation:

    receive
        |
        v
    persist lease
        |
        v
    queue restart
        |
        v
    restore IN_FLIGHT

This prevents restart itself from changing delivery semantics.

### Cost

`receive()` now includes durable storage work.

Every delivery attempt adds another WAL record.

This may:

- increase receive latency;
- increase WAL write volume;
- increase WAL growth rate;
- increase recovery work.

These effects have not yet been benchmarked.

### Alternative — Immediately Requeue After Restart

Gain:

- simple recovery;
- no need to persist delivery ownership.

Cost:

- restart becomes implicit lease cancellation;
- potential premature duplicate delivery;
- existing consumer ownership is lost.

Rejected.

### Alternative — Preserve Lease Time but Not Receipt Handle

Gain:

- prevents premature redelivery.

Cost:

- old consumer cannot ACK/NACK after queue restart;
- successfully processed messages may later be redelivered.

Rejected.

### Selected Trade-off

Preserve the complete lease.

This makes the semantic model stronger and more internally consistent at the
cost of additional durable writes on the receive path.

### Revisit When

Revisit this decision if measurements show that durable lease creation is a
meaningful throughput or latency bottleneck.

Any optimization must explicitly state whether it preserves the same durability
contract.

## v0.12.1 — Snapshot WAL Position: Segment ID + Offset

### Decision

Represent snapshot recovery position as:

    WalPosition(segmentId, offset)

The current single-file WAL uses:

    segmentId = 0

### Why

A bare byte offset works for a single WAL file but becomes ambiguous once the
WAL is segmented.

Using a segment ID preserves direct physical replay semantics while allowing
the WAL to evolve toward:

    segment-N.wal

without changing the snapshot-position contract.

### Gain

- Direct mapping to FileChannel seeking.
- Clear physical recovery location.
- Future WAL segmentation fits naturally.
- Avoids prematurely introducing logical sequence numbering.
- Snapshot recovery remains simple.

### Cost

- Position is coupled to physical storage layout.
- Segment lifecycle rules will eventually be required.
- Compaction may need position translation or segment-retention rules.
- Does not solve logical ordering across replicated nodes.

### Alternative — Bare Byte Offset

Simpler today:

    offset = 12480

Rejected because the value becomes ambiguous with multiple WAL files.

### Alternative — Logical Sequence Number

Example:

    sequence = 10948

Advantages:

- independent of physical WAL layout;
- potentially useful for replication and distributed ordering.

Costs:

- requires sequence allocation semantics;
- requires mapping sequence numbers back to physical storage;
- introduces machinery not needed for current local recovery.

Deferred until the architecture requires logical-log identity.

### Current Constraint

The implementation currently supports one WAL segment only.

Therefore:

    segmentId = 0

No segmentation behavior should be added merely because the abstraction
contains a segment identifier.

### Concurrency Trade-off

The snapshot state and WalPosition must be captured consistently.

Current choice:

    briefly hold the queue state lock
    capture state + durable WalPosition
    release lock
    write snapshot outside the lock

This may briefly pause queue mutations during snapshot capture.

The duration and contention impact have not yet been measured.

### Revisit When

Revisit when:

- snapshot copying becomes expensive;
- lock contention is measured;
- WAL segmentation is implemented;
- dedicated WAL writer/group commit is introduced;
- distributed replication requires logical log indexes.

## v0.12.5 — Segmented WAL

### Decision

Replace unbounded single-file WAL growth with a sequence of WAL segments.

The highest authoritative `.wal` segment is active.

All lower segments are sealed and immutable.

### Motivation

Snapshot-based recovery makes older WAL history logically redundant.

A single WAL file makes physical prefix reclamation difficult because removing
old bytes would require rewriting the remaining active log.

Segments allow future compaction to delete whole immutable files.

### Segment Size Policy

Segment size is a target rather than a hard limit.

A record that causes the target to be exceeded remains entirely in the current
segment.

Rotation occurs before the following append.

### Gain

- Sealed WAL history becomes immutable.
- Frames never cross physical files.
- Future history reclamation can delete whole segments.
- Snapshot WalPosition naturally maps to `(segmentId, offset)`.
- Active-tail crash repair remains localized to the newest segment.
- No separate manifest or ACTIVE flag is currently required.

### Cost

- More files must be discovered and validated.
- Segment continuity becomes an invariant.
- Recovery spans multiple files.
- Rotation introduces additional failure points.
- Atomic filesystem rename is part of correctness.
- Sealed and active segments require different torn-tail policies.

### Authority Trade-off

We derive segment state from filenames:

    highest *.wal = active
    lower *.wal   = sealed
    *.tmp         = non-authoritative

This avoids maintaining separate mutable lifecycle metadata.

The trade-off is tighter dependence on filesystem naming and directory
discovery.

### Recovery Trade-off

Active segment:

    torn tail -> truncate/recover

Sealed segment:

    torn tail -> fail

This is intentionally stricter for sealed history because the existence of a
newer segment proves the old segment should already have been complete before
rotation.

### Rotation Failure Policy

Before atomic promotion:

    old segment remains authoritative.

After atomic promotion:

    new segment is authoritative even if the current process fails to open or
    activate it.

In the latter case, the current WAL instance must stop writing and restart.

### Append Failure Policy

A failed append may leave a partial frame.

The current WAL instance is poisoned so another complete frame can never be
written behind the torn frame.

Restart repairs the active tail before writes resume.

### Deferred

Not included in this version:

- physical deletion of sealed segments;
- segment manifest;
- distributed replication;
- logical record sequence numbers;
- multiple concurrent WAL writers;
- dedicated writer thread;
- group commit.

These should only be introduced when the corresponding requirement appears.

## v0.13.0 — Snapshot-Authorized WAL Segment Reclamation

### Decision

Use the latest successfully promoted snapshot as the sole authority for
whole-segment WAL reclamation. Retain the snapshot's segment and every newer
segment; delete only lower segment IDs.

### Motivation

Without reclamation, segmentation merely converts one unbounded file into an
unbounded directory. Snapshot promotion already establishes a durable recovery
point, so it is the natural authorization boundary for removing redundant WAL
history.

### Gain

- WAL disk usage can shrink without rewriting live log data.
- Planning is deterministic and independently testable.
- The boundary segment remains available for replay from the snapshot offset.
- A partial deletion failure is safe to retry.
- Failed and stale snapshots cannot expose recovery to premature deletion.

### Cost

- Snapshot commit may report a compaction failure after the snapshot itself is
  already authoritative; callers must treat reclamation as retryable cleanup.
- Filesystem deletion errors can leave more history than necessary.
- Whole-segment reclamation may retain unused bytes before the snapshot offset
  in the boundary segment.
- Snapshot commit and deletion are serialized by the coordinator.

### Conservative boundary trade-off

The implementation does not rewrite the boundary segment to recover its unused
prefix. This sacrifices some disk efficiency in exchange for immutable sealed
segments, simpler crash recovery, and a much smaller correctness surface.

### Failure policy

Deletion is not transactional. On failure, already deleted segments stay
deleted and remaining eligible segments stay present. This is safe because the
authoritative snapshot precedes every delete and each target is independently
proven redundant.

### Deferred

- boundary-segment prefix rewriting;
- background/asynchronous reclamation;
- deletion tombstones or a segment manifest;
- retention policies independent of recovery safety;
- coordination with replicas or remote snapshots.

## v0.14.0 — Fail Closed After WAL Prefix Reclamation

### Decision

Allow missing/corrupt snapshot fallback only while the WAL still begins at
segment 0. Once an earlier segment prefix has been reclaimed, require a valid
snapshot and retained suffix as one recovery chain.

### Gain

- prevents silent partial recovery;
- preserves WAL-only recovery before compaction;
- reconstructs monotonic snapshot authority after restart;
- rejects invalid snapshot positions before promotion.

### Cost

- snapshot loss after reclamation is now an availability failure;
- position validation can scan a segment to prove a frame boundary;
- segment numbering becomes part of the recovery-authority model.

### Deferred

- a persistent segment manifest;
- queue-generation or storage-lineage identifiers;
- remote snapshot restoration;
- automatic snapshot and reclamation scheduling.

## v0.15.0 — Force Parent Directories at Authority Boundaries

### Decision

Force the containing directory after snapshot promotion, WAL segment creation
or promotion, and each reclaimed segment deletion. Do not silently accept
filesystems that cannot provide this operation.

### Gain

- aligns reported durability with both file data and filesystem namespace;
- prevents promoted segment names from being treated as durable too early;
- prevents failed snapshot metadata durability from authorizing compaction;
- makes deletion progress durable in the same order it is observed.

### Cost

- adds synchronous filesystem operations to infrequent lifecycle paths;
- directory forcing is filesystem and operating-system dependent;
- failure after atomic promotion is inherently indeterminate and requires
  fail-closed handling rather than rollback claims.

### Deferred

- batching deletion metadata forces;
- a storage abstraction for non-POSIX filesystems;
- filesystem-specific durability certification;
- replicated durability.

## v0.16.0 — Segment-Distance Checkpoint Scheduling

### Decision

Run storage maintenance through a single fixed-delay lifecycle manager. Use
distance in WAL segment IDs from the latest authoritative snapshot as the
initial checkpoint policy.

### Gain

- WAL reclamation no longer depends on application code remembering each
  checkpoint;
- the trigger is derived from durable physical progress and survives restart;
- policy is deterministic and independently testable;
- failed cleanup is retried even without a newer snapshot;
- maintenance failure is isolated from completed queue mutations.

### Cost

- introduces a managed background thread and explicit shutdown responsibility;
- snapshot capture and filesystem maintenance still consume queue/storage
  resources;
- segment distance is an approximate disk bound, not an exact byte bound;
- callers must monitor exposed lifecycle failure state.

### Deferred

- byte-accurate WAL usage policy;
- adaptive or time-based checkpoint triggers;
- asynchronous snapshot serialization from an immutable state view;
- metrics and external health endpoints;
- distributed maintenance ownership.

## v0.17.0 — Embed Storage Lineage in WAL and Snapshots

### Decision

Persist `(queueId, generationId, partitionId)` in every WAL segment and
snapshot, and require exact equality across recovery and compaction authority
transitions. Reject pre-lineage formats instead of adding migration machinery.

### Gain

- prevents valid but unrelated artifacts from being combined during restore;
- prevents a foreign snapshot from authorizing deletion of local WAL history;
- makes queue generation and partition identity explicit before ownership and
  replication are introduced;
- creates a reusable fencing dimension for later placement epochs.

### Cost

- WAL and snapshot formats advance to version 2;
- existing v1 storage cannot be opened by this release;
- UUID metadata increases each WAL segment header and snapshot payload;
- correct backup/restore must preserve the complete lineage tuple.

### Deferred

- migration from v1 artifacts;
- queue namespace and customer tenancy metadata;
- partition routing and ownership epochs;
- replicated generation creation and consensus-backed metadata.

## v0.18.0 — PostgreSQL Metadata Authority

### Decision

Introduce an independently packaged Spring Boot metadata service whose durable
repository is PostgreSQL. Use database transactions for idempotent creation,
conditional updates for lifecycle fencing, and Flyway for schema authority.
Keep message data in the separate `queue-core` module.

### Gain

- provides a shared, durable multi-tenant queue namespace;
- makes ambiguous create retries safe;
- exposes lifecycle progress instead of hiding cross-resource partial work;
- introduces generation and version fencing before distributed provisioning;
- allows multiple future service instances to share metadata authority.

### Cost

- PostgreSQL becomes an operational dependency and availability boundary;
- the service adds a REST API and database connection-pool management concerns;
- metadata and queue storage cannot participate in one atomic transaction;
- schema evolution now requires an explicit production migration strategy;
- Spring Boot becomes part of the control-plane runtime dependency surface.

### Deferred

- queue-node registration and storage provisioning;
- reconciliation of stuck lifecycle states;
- partition placement and ownership epochs;
- authentication, authorization, quotas, and rate limits;
- schema rollback policy and zero-downtime migration compatibility;
- metadata replication beyond PostgreSQL's own deployment model.

## v0.19.0 — Lease-Fenced Queue Provisioning

### Decision

Provision queue storage through a separately deployed queue-node reconciler.
PostgreSQL grants one finite claim for an eligible `PROVISIONING` descriptor
and increments a durable fencing token whenever an expired claim is taken
over. Storage creation is deterministic and bound to the descriptor's exact
queue, generation, and partition lineage. Only the current, unexpired claim
may publish `ACTIVE` or `PROVISIONING_FAILED`.

### Gain

- closes the metadata/filesystem transaction gap through observable,
  retryable reconciliation;
- prevents a delayed worker from publishing lifecycle state after takeover;
- makes worker crash recovery independent of process-local locks;
- exercises leases, fencing, idempotence, and conditional publication across
  service and storage boundaries;
- preserves PostgreSQL as control-plane authority and the WAL as data-plane
  durability authority.

### Cost

- queue readiness becomes asynchronous after a successful create request;
- correctness depends on bounded claim duration and database time;
- a worker that exceeds its lease may finish harmless storage work but cannot
  publish it;
- claim records remain after completion to make ambiguous completion retries
  idempotent;
- the internal provisioning API adds an operational trust boundary.

### Deferred

- claim renewal for long-running provisioning;
- authenticated service-to-service APIs;
- durable node registration and health;
- partition placement and runtime ownership epochs;
- automatic retry policy for `PROVISIONING_FAILED` descriptors;
- deletion reconciliation and storage garbage collection.

## v0.20.0 — Durable Node Registry and Partition Placement

### Decision

Make PostgreSQL authoritative for queue-node process registrations and initial
partition placement. Fence repeated use of a stable node ID with a registration
epoch, renew liveness through finite heartbeats, and create one durable
placement before provisioning. Select the live node with the fewest placements,
using node ID as a deterministic tie-breaker.

### Gain

- metadata can answer where each partition is intended to live;
- anonymous workers can no longer provision arbitrary queues;
- duplicate processes using one node ID are explicitly fenced;
- provisioning completion proves current node, placement, and claim authority;
- placement establishes the routing prerequisite for a future data-plane API.

### Cost

- node availability now depends on timely metadata heartbeats;
- wall-clock lease assumptions extend from claims to membership;
- count-based placement ignores disk size, queue traffic, and node capacity;
- a metadata outage eventually removes every node's permission to do new work;
- placements on expired nodes remain unavailable instead of moving.

### Deferred

- automatic reassignment and storage transfer;
- node capacity, zones, draining, and placement constraints;
- runtime ownership leases and message-serving endpoints;
- replicated storage and recovery-source selection;
- authenticated node identity and transport security.

## v0.21.0 — Fenced Runtime Partition Activation

### Decision

Recover only node-specific `ACTIVE` placements into managed local queue
runtimes. Define runtime authority as the composition of queue lineage,
registration epoch and lease, and placement epoch. Publish `READY` or `FAILED`
through PostgreSQL only after revalidating every authority dimension.

### Gain

- placement now leads to an observable, recovered runtime;
- stale process and placement recoveries cannot publish readiness;
- runtime resources have one owner and deterministic close paths;
- one recovery failure does not block unrelated partitions;
- the next data-plane milestone can depend on a tested `READY` boundary.

### Cost

- metadata availability and timely heartbeats gate runtime availability;
- polling creates bounded authority-change detection delay;
- runtime status is last-published observation and can outlive its node lease;
- local activation still cannot make storage movable to another node.

### Deferred

- public message operations and routing;
- producer idempotency;
- reassignment, storage transfer, and replication;
- push notification and large-topology pagination.

## v0.22.0 — Authority-Guarded Node-Local Data Plane

### Decision

Expose publish, receive, ACK, and NACK from the queue node and admit them only
through `RuntimePartitionManager`. Hold the manager's lifecycle monitor for the
complete local queue operation so runtime closure and operation execution have
one explicit order. Revalidate the matching registration lease at admission.

### Gain

- completes the first end-to-end path from shared metadata to durable message
  mutation;
- prevents request handlers from retaining or bypassing managed runtimes;
- uses an O(1) queue-ID serving index instead of scanning all active runtimes;
- closes the race between local runtime close and a concurrent operation;
- preserves all existing WAL and receipt-handle semantics behind HTTP;
- applies clock-driven expiry and delayed-retry transitions at request
  boundaries rather than permitting stale receipt acceptance;
- creates the real ambiguous-response boundary needed to design producer
  idempotency from an observed failure rather than a hypothetical API.

### Cost

- one monitor serializes lifecycle changes with all operations across runtimes
  on a node;
- a slow WAL force delays deactivation and operations for other local queues;
- clients must discover and directly address the assigned node;
- placement changes are learned by polling, not checked in PostgreSQL for every
  request;
- an HTTP timeout after commit remains ambiguous and can produce duplicates.

### Deferred

- per-partition lifecycle guards or reference-counted runtime handles;
- stable routing, proxying, and client endpoint discovery;
- producer idempotency and durable deduplication;
- admission control, quotas, and payload limits;
- reassignment, replication, leader election, and multi-partition routing;
- authentication, authorization, and transport security.

## v0.22.1 — Reproducible Performance Baseline

### Decision

Add an isolated JMH module and retain versioned raw results in the repository.
Measure non-durable engine cost separately from forced-WAL operations and
measure runtime admission with both 1 and 1,000 active queues. Keep the suite
short enough for developer execution and label it as diagnostic evidence, not
capacity certification.

### Gain

- establishes evidence before optimizing the node-wide lifecycle guard;
- confirms READY lookup cost is independent of the number of active queues;
- quantifies the large cost boundary between in-memory mutation and forced WAL;
- makes later performance claims reviewable against raw iteration data;
- records benchmark state scope so concurrency numbers have an explicit meaning.

### Cost

- adds a build-only JMH dependency and a fourth Maven module;
- the executable benchmark artifact requires the queue-node thin JAR, so its
  Spring Boot executable is now attached with the `exec` classifier;
- short developer runs have wide confidence intervals and cannot size a
  production deployment;
- results remain sensitive to JVM, filesystem, device, and competing workloads.

### Deferred

- stable CI performance gates and regression thresholds;
- HTTP and JSON serialization benchmarks;
- controlled storage-device and WAL concurrency experiments;
- profiling-guided lifecycle-lock redesign;
- soak, recovery-time, and capacity benchmarks.

## v0.23.0 — Per-Partition Runtime Admission and Draining

### Decision

Replace the node-wide data-plane monitor with one lifecycle handle per active
partition. Use a concurrent serving index, handle-local state and operation
count, and an `AutoCloseable` permit. Keep reconciliation serialized while
allowing queue callbacks to run outside manager and handle locks.

### Gain

- isolates unrelated queues from another partition's slow WAL operation;
- preserves an explicit same-partition operation-versus-close order;
- rejects stale references through handle state, not map visibility alone;
- makes active-operation draining observable in the concurrency model;
- creates a natural boundary for later per-partition admission limits.

### Cost

- introduces lifecycle state and reference accounting that must remain balanced;
- shutdown may wait indefinitely for an admitted operation that never returns;
- a concurrent serving index and synchronized lifecycle map have different
  responsibilities that reviewers must understand;
- operations targeting the same local queue remain serialized by the queue;
- reconciliation and runtime recovery remain node-wide serialized work.

### Deferred

- bounded drain timeout and forced cancellation policy;
- per-partition metrics for active permits and drain duration;
- parallel or capacity-limited recovery scheduling;
- queue-depth, byte, and request admission control;
- distributed ownership transfer and replicated storage.

## v0.24.0 — Bounded Retained-Message Admission

### Decision

Reject a publish before WAL append when its UTF-8 payload exceeds the message
limit or when accepting it would exceed the partition's retained-message or
retained-payload-byte limit. Count every non-ACKed state, including DLQ, and
rebuild counters from recovered logical state.

### Gain

- overload becomes an explicit, retryable API outcome rather than incidental
  heap or WAL failure;
- checks and accounting are atomic under the existing queue mutation lock;
- rejected publishes leave no durable or volatile trace;
- recovery preserves admission behavior without changing snapshot or WAL
  formats;
- an operator can lower limits and still start the queue to drain it.

### Cost

- UTF-8 length calculation allocates an encoded byte array on every publish;
- logical payload bytes underestimate actual heap and filesystem consumption;
- global node configuration gives every queue the same limits;
- DLQ messages permanently consume capacity until removal is implemented;
- HTTP 429 communicates backpressure but cannot provide an accurate
  `Retry-After` time because release depends on consumer acknowledgements.

### Deferred

- per-tenant and metadata-managed per-queue quotas;
- filesystem free-space reservation and emergency disk thresholds;
- request-rate limiting, fairness, and producer-specific quotas;
- DLQ inspection and deletion APIs;
- admission metrics and dynamic configuration changes.

## v0.25.0 — Stable Data-Plane Routing Gateway

### Decision

Add a separate hexagonal Spring Boot gateway. Resolve a fully fenced READY
route from metadata for every operation, forward once, preserve the node
response, and surface transport ambiguity without retry.

### Gain

- customers use stable queue URLs independent of node placement;
- route authority is derived from one coherent PostgreSQL statement;
- metadata, routing, and durable execution retain separate ownership;
- downstream capacity, empty-queue, receipt, and availability semantics remain
  visible through the gateway;
- the code creates the routing seam required before ownership transfer and
  replication.

### Cost

- every operation adds a metadata HTTP call and PostgreSQL query;
- metadata-service availability and latency are now on this uncached path;
- forwarding adds a network hop and preserves ambiguous mutation outcomes;
- the gateway becomes another deployable service to operate;
- direct queue-node endpoints still exist inside the trusted network.

### Deferred

- bounded route caching and invalidation;
- safe retry policies and producer idempotency;
- authentication, authorization, TLS, and endpoint allow-listing;
- partition-key routing and multi-partition queues;
- ownership transfer, replicated logs, and leader-aware routing.

## v0.26.0 — Ordered Follower WAL Protocol

### Decision

Add a queue-core follower storage protocol with lineage, a global logical
sequence, and a durable highest-leader-epoch fence. Reuse the existing WAL for
record durability and require complete history while sequence metadata is not
yet integrated with snapshots.

### Gain

- exact retries do not duplicate follower records;
- gaps, conflicting history, wrong lineage, and stale leaders fail closed;
- stale-leader fencing survives process restart;
- advancing the epoch before WAL append gives a safe crash ordering;
- the protocol is independently testable without prematurely coupling it to
  metadata, HTTP, placement, or leader election.

### Cost

- opening the follower loads complete WAL history and duplicate validation is
  backed by an in-memory record list;
- a separate small epoch authority file adds another durable artifact;
- advancing an epoch may survive even when its first record does not;
- reclaimed WAL history cannot yet recover the logical sequence safely.

### Deferred

- replication transport, batching, flow control, and catch-up;
- snapshot-carried logical indexes and replication-aware reclamation;
- leader commit index, quorum acknowledgement, and replica membership;
- election, promotion, log truncation, and divergence repair.

## v0.27.0 — Bounded Replica Transport and Catch-Up

### Decision

Expose the v0.26 follower protocol through a bounded internal queue-node HTTP
endpoint. Represent a batch with one lineage, epoch, first sequence, and a
consecutive record list. Provide an HTTP client and a one-attempt catch-up
service behind application ports, but do not invent replica membership.

### Gain

- WAL records can cross a real process and node boundary;
- ambiguous response retries remain idempotent across an entire batch;
- bounded work limits memory, request size, and failure blast radius;
- partial durable progress is observable and safely resumable;
- transport remains separate from follower storage correctness.

### Cost

- batches are not atomic and may commit a prefix;
- follower logs are opened lazily and retained until node shutdown;
- the internal endpoint is not yet authenticated;
- there is no automatic scheduler because metadata has no replica membership;
- logical catch-up still requires complete retained WAL history.

### Deferred

- replication-aware snapshots and historical sequence retention;
- membership, automatic scheduling, lag metrics, and backoff orchestration;
- quorum acknowledgement and leader commit index;
- election, promotion, truncation, and repair.

## v0.28.0 — Durable Logical Replicated Log

### Decision

Store consecutive logical index, originating term, and queue mutation in every
segmented-WAL frame. Keep local `WalPosition` as a separate physical boundary,
extend snapshots with the compacted index and term, publish lineage-bound
replica hard state, and make a validated follower batch one force group.

### Gain

- logical identity survives rotation, restart, and snapshot-authorized prefix
  reclamation;
- retry and conflict detection no longer depend on retained record count;
- snapshots preserve the historical term needed to match a compacted prefix;
- hard state establishes durable term, vote, and commit authority for later
  elections and quorum commit;
- one force covers a complete bounded batch instead of forcing every record;
- the public queue contract and existing single-node behavior remain unchanged.

### Cost

- WAL and snapshot formats intentionally advance and older files are rejected;
- startup scans every retained entry to rebuild the in-memory logical index;
- hard state adds an independently published artifact and ordering constraints;
- a failed batch can leave a complete prefix and requires restart recovery;
- an oversized durability group may exceed the normal segment target;
- local commit and future majority commit must remain explicitly distinguished.

### Deferred

- automatic replication scheduling and replica membership;
- majority acknowledgement and committed-only state-machine application;
- leader election, promotion eligibility, and divergent suffix truncation;
- snapshot transfer and automatic replica replacement;
- persistent sparse indexes and cross-partition asynchronous group commit.
